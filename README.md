# 2d-static-orbits
Modelling simple 2D orbit, like a satellite orbiting the earth.
The orbit looks roughly elliptical, the distance from the Earth to the point farthest away from Earth on the orbit (called apogee) looks to be 
about 1.5 units, which is consistent with a semi-major axis of 1.0 units and an eccentricity of 0.50
